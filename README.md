# Instagram-Chat-Message-Counter
This attempts to count the number of messages sent in an Instagram Direct Message. It takes a file as input and proceeds to find the occurences of specific sequences to increment message counters. 
# I aim to extend this feature to comments and other statistics provided by Instagram based on the data.
